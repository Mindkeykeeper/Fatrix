<p>program and I decided to take a chance. To my surprise, the program is exactly what they said it was and now i'm greatful that I was given this opprtunity. I'm learning about hardware, software, web delopment, professional skills, and life skills. The program is more than just technology. It also offers advising with personal issues and just issues that you migth have with some of your classes.</p>
	<p>After my succesful graduation of the program, I will find a stable job and then go back to college to finish my education. While doing this I also plan to work on my some of my hobbies such as sewing and learning more about biology. These are two of the things that I enjoy doing on my free time and would like expand my knowledge on them. One thing that I really want to learn in regards to sewing is learn how to tailor all clothes. For instance, suits and pants. Not only is it convinient, but also fun for me.</p>
